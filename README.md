# Google App Engine labs
A couple of small demos of what can be accomplished with App Engine's APIs.

This material was presented at an Appsterdam's Guru Session on Google App Engine ([slides](http://abahgat.github.io/gae4beginners)).

## Channel
The Channel API used to show a small arrow icon corresponding to the position of the mouse cursor of every user looking at a web page.
